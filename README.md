Thermal Load Calculator using Manual J Calculation

Attempt to see if I am able to recreate the Manual J calculation for Thermal Load,
as was referenced in a recent video by technology connections, about a lack of software.

This is mostly a scratch exercise for working out the formulas as I understand them,
and see if they match examples I can find.

Assuming I remember my math courses, and this goes well I expect to be able to handle simple walls
fairly quickly. After that I can look into setting up a prototype GUI.
